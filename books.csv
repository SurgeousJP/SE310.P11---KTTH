"469138","eng","3","In this riveting and richly drawn novel from ""one of the master storytellers of historical fiction"" (New York Times bestseller Beatriz Williams), a talented young artist flees New York for Paris after one of her scandalous drawings reveals a dark secret--and triggers a terrible tragedy.\nIn the wake of a dark and brutal World War, the glitz and glamour of 1925 Manhattan shine like a beacon for the high society set, which is desperate to keep their gaze firmly fixed to the future. But Delphine Duplessi sees more than most. At a time in her career when she could easily be unknown and penniless, like so many of her classmates from L'Ecole de Beaux Arts, in America she has gained notoriety for her stunning ""shadow portraits"" that frequently expose her subjects' most scandalous secrets--for better or for worse. Most nights Delphine doesn't mind that her gift has become mere entertainment--a party trick--for the fashionable crowd. Though her ancestor La Lune, the legendary sixteenth-century courtesan and--like Delphine--a witch, might have thought differently.\nThen, on a snowy night in February, in a penthouse high above Fifth Avenue, Delphine's mystical talent leads to a tragedy between two brothers. Horrified, she renounces her gift.\nDevastated and disconsolate, Delphine returns to her old life in the south of France where Picasso, Matisse, and the Fitzgeralds are summering. There, Delphine is thrust into recapturing the past. First by her charismatic twin brother and business manager Sebastian in his attempts to cajole her back to work and into co-dependence, then by the world famous opera singer Emma Calve, who is obsessed with the centuries-old Book of Abraham, written by the fourteenth-century alchemist Nicolas Flamel. And finally by her ex-lover Mathieu, who is determined to lure her back into his arms, unaware of the danger that had led Delphine to flee Paris for New York five years before.\nTrapped in an ancient chateau where hidden knowledge lurks in the shadows, Delphine questions and in many ways rejects what and who she loves the most--her art, her magick, her family, her brother, and Mathieu--as she tries to finally accept them as the gifts they are and to shed her fear of loving and living with her eyes wide open.","368","18","7","2017","9781476778129","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620363-the-library-of-light-and-shadow","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1482112784i/32620363.jpg","378","The Library of Light and Shadow (Daughters of La Lune #3)","The Library of Light and Shadow (Daughters of La Lune #3)","48.51","851","9.99 x 11.15 x 2.69 inches","0.87","1.55","1","1","M.J.

A thousand times, yes.\n""\nAccalaimed novelist Susan Johnson found, at age thirty-five, that her arms began to feel ""empty."" Soon her desire to have a baby became overwhelming. She had no inkling then what motherhood would cost her -- or give her.

Facing major surgery, Susan calls herself ""a one-woman catastrophe, a small ruined country.""

La Fantasie Russie is owned by Pavel Orloff, protege to the famous Faberge, and is known by the city's fashion elite as the place to find the rarest of gemstones and the most unique designs.

Contada con el lirismo de la tradicion cantarina y pictorica del nahuatl, Laura Esquivel nos brinda un mito fundacional de la cultura hibrida del Nuevo Mundo y una extraordinaria historia de amor.","189","7","2","2006","9780743290340","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25516.Malinche","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","90","Malinche","Malinche","56.83","1161","5.09 x 9.3 x 2.85 inches","0.94","2.01","1","1","Laura Esquivel","16","18"
"469263","en-US","3","This is an extraordinary retelling of the passionate and tragic love between the conquistador Cortez and the Indian woman Malinalli, his interpreter during his conquest of the Aztecs. Malinalli's Indian tribe has been conquered by the warrior Aztecs. When her father is killed in battle, she is raised by her wisewoman grandmother who imparts to her the knowledge that their founding forefather god, Quetzalcoatl, had abandoned them after being made drunk by a trickster god and committing incest with his sister. But he was determined to return with the rising sun and save her tribe from their present captivity. When Malinalli meets Cortez she, like many, suspects that he is the returning Quetzalcoatl, and assumes her task is to welcome him and help him destroy the Aztec empire and free her people. The two fall passionately in love, but Malinalli gradually comes to realize that Cortez's thirst for conquest is all too human, and that for gold and power, he is willing to destroy anyone, even his own men, even their own love.","191","2","5","2006","9780743290333","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25517.Malinche","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","2525","Malinche","Malinche","79.26","385","9.14 x 13.72 x 0.63 inches","0.78","2.56","1","1","Laura Esquivel","17","17"
"469269","eng","4","The remarkable true story of acclaimed opera singer Charity Tillemann-Dick, who received not one but two double lung transplants and went from struggling to draw a single breath to singing at the most prestigious venues in the world.\nCharity Tillemann-Dick was a vivacious young American soprano studying at the celebrated Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest when she received devastating news: her lungs were failing, her heart was three and a half sizes too big, and she would die within five years. Inexplicably, despite her fatal pulmonary condition, she could still sing. Medical experts advised Charity to abandon her musical dreams, but if her time was running out, she wanted to spend it doing what she loved.\nIn just three years, she endured two double lung transplants. Teetering between life and death, she slowly learned to breathe, walk, talk, eat, and sing again. With new lungs and fierce determination, she eventually fell in love, rebuilt her career, and reclaimed her life. Over a decade after her diagnosis, she has a chart-topping album, performs around the globe, and is a leading voice for organ donation.\nWeaving Charity's extraordinary tale of triumph with those of opera's greatest heroines, The Encore illuminates the indomitable human spirit. It's the story of confronting devastating challenges with love: the intimate love of a mother for her daughter, a man for a woman, a doctor for her craft, and a singer for her music. Ultimately, grace from God and strangers enabled the work of love to save one young woman's breath and allowed her to reclaim her life.","320","3","10","2017","9781501102318","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814269-the-encore","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502043648i/25814269.jpg","36","The Encore: A Memoir in Three Acts","The Encore: A Memoir in Three Acts","44.14","466","6.7 x 11.47 x 0.85 inches","0.05","2.98","1","1","Charity Tillemann-Dick","18","22"

But hidden inside the socially awkward, fussy busybody is a woman who has more imagination, bigger dreams, and a warmer heart that anyone around her realizes.\nWhen Britt-Marie walks out on her cheating husband and has to fend for herself in the miserable backwater town of Borg--of which the kindest thing one can say is that it has a road going through it--she finds work as the caretaker of a soon-to-be demolished recreation center.

The place: Europe. The time: 25,000 years ago, the last Ice Age. In reality, you live in an open-air tent or a bone hut. But you also belong to a rich culture that creates art. In and around your cave paintings are handprints and dots, x's and triangles, parallel lines and spirals. Your people know what they mean. You also use them on tools and jewelry. And then you vanish--and with you, their meanings.\nJoin renowned archaeologist Genevieve von Petzinger on an Indiana Jones-worthy adventure from the open-air rock art sites of northern Portugal to the dark depths of a remote cave in Spain that can only be reached by sliding face-first through the mud. Von Petzinger looks past the beautiful horses, powerful bison, graceful ibex, and faceless humans in the ancient paintings. Instead, she's obsessed with the abstract geometric images that accompany them, the terse symbols that appear more often than any other kinds of figures--signs that have never really been studied or explained until now.\nPart travel journal, part popular science, part personal narrative, von Petzinger's groundbreaking book starts to crack the code on the first form of graphic communication. It's in her blood, as this talented scientist's grandmother served as a code-breaker at Bletchley. Discernible patterns emerge that point to abstract thought and expression, and for the first time, we can begin to understand the changes that might have been happening inside the minds of our Ice Age ancestors--offering a glimpse of when they became us.","307","31","5","2016","9781476785493","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814327-the-first-signs","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1464517883i/25814327.jpg","113","The First Signs: Unlocking the Mysteries of the World's Oldest Symbols","The First Signs: Unlocking the Mysteries of the World's Oldest Symbols","83.39","1064","8.5 x 7.57 x 1.64 inches","0.79","1.8","1","1","Genevieve von Petzinger","20","12"

There dwells, somewhere in Russia, a man so powerful no one even knows his name. His existence is only speculated upon, only whispered about in American corridors of power and CIA strategy meetings. Though he is all but invisible, he is pulling strings and pulling them hard. For suddenly, Russia is a far, far more ominous threat than even the most hardened cold warriors ever thought possible. The Russians have their finger on the switch to the European economy and an eye on the American jugular. And, most importantly, they want to be made whole again. Should America interfere with Russia's plans to ""reintegrate"" her rogue states, well then, America will pay in blood. \nIn Ted Bell's latest pulse-pounding and action-packed tour de force, Alex Hawke must face a global nightmare of epic proportions. As this political crisis plays out, Russia gains a new leader. Not just a president, but a new tsar, a signal to the world that the old, imperial Russia is back and plans to have her day. And in America, a mysterious killer, known only as Happy the Baker, brutally murders an innocent family and literally flattens the small Midwestern town they once called home. Just a taste, according to the new tsar, of what will happen if America does not back down.

"469310","en-US","4","Meet the ladies: a flock of smart, affectionate, highly individualistic chickens who visit their favorite neighbors, devise different ways to hide from foxes, and mob the author like she's a rock star. In these pages you'll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance--but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky.\nSnowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who's now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You'll meet Harris's hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you'll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are.\nEach of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird--and these are the lessons of Birdology: that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In Birdology, beloved author of The Good Good Pig Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds--wild, tame, exotic, and common--she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom.\nThe first lesson of Birdology is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery's distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you'll come face to face with a cassowary--a 150-pound, man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people--proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You'll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city's downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us.\nBirdology explains just how very ""other"" birds are: Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds' and humans' disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of Birdology: it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.","260","6","4","2010","9781416569848","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7059341-birdology","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1269473463i/7059341.jpg","769","Birdology: Adventures with a Pack of Hens, a Peck of Pigeons, Cantankerous Crows, Fierce Falcons, Hip Hop Parrots, Baby Hummingbirds, and One Murderously Big Living Dinosaur","Birdology: Adventures with a Pack of Hens, a Peck of Pigeons, Cantankerous Crows, Fierce Falcons, Hip Hop Parrots, Baby Hummingbirds, and One Murderously Big Living Dinosaur","99.56","584","5.33 x 8.84 x 0.88 inches","0.87","1.72","1","1","Sy Montgomery","23","14"

"469384","eng","4","In 2011, Marie Clairemagazine published a profile of Janet Mock in which she stepped forward for the first time as a trans woman. Those twenty-three hundred words were life-altering for the People.com editor, turning her into an influential and outspoken public figure and a desperately needed voice for an often voiceless community. In these pages, she offers a bold and inspiring perspective on being young, multicultural, economically challenged, and transgender in America.\nWelcomed into the world as her parents' firstborn son, Mock decided early on that she would be her own person--no matter what. She struggled as the smart, determined child in a deeply loving yet ill-equipped family that lacked the money, education, and resources necessary to help her thrive. Mock navigated her way through her teen years without parental guidance, but luckily, with the support of a few close friends and mentors, she emerged much stronger, ready to take on--and maybe even change--the world.\nThis powerful memoir follows Mock's quest for identity, from an early, unwavering conviction about her gender to a turbulent adolescence in Honolulu that saw her transitioning during the tender years of high school, self-medicating with hormones at fifteen, and flying across the world alone for sex reassignment surgery at just eighteen. With unflinching honesty, Mock uses her own experience to impart vital insight about the unique challenges and vulnerabilities of trans youth and brave girls like herself.\nDespite the hurdles, Mock received a scholarship to college and moved to New York City, where she earned a master's degree, enjoyed the success of an enviable career, and told no one about her past. She remained deeply guarded until she fell for a man who called her the woman of his dreams. Love fortified her with the strength to finally tell her story, enabling her to embody the undeniable power of testimony and become a fierce advocate for a marginalized and misunderstood community. A profound statement of affirmation from a courageous woman, Redefining Realnessprovides a whole new outlook on what it means to be a woman today, and shows as never before how to be authentic, unapologetic, and wholly yourself.","263","2","12","2014","9781476709130","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22309868-redefining-realness","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1417601997i/22309868.jpg","183","Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love  So Much More","Redefining Realness: My Path to Womanhood, Identity, Love  So Much More","72.8","1131","7.49 x 10.94 x 1.07 inches","0.07","1.74","2","1","Janet Mock","33","22"

"469417","eng","3","A brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life which will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.\nOne of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home.\nIt started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him.\nIt was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall.\nAnd so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that.\nWhat does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.\nBetween a Rock and a Hard Place -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories.","368","30","8","2005","9780743492829","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/166562.Between_a_Rock_and_a_Hard_Place","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","14484","Between a Rock and a Hard Place","Between a Rock and a Hard Place","56.07","1114","7.47 x 10.5 x 0.94 inches","0.06","1.81","2","1","Aron Ralston","37","12"

But, what happened to the fairest, noblest, and finest profession that de la Vega saw?\nDe la Vega hit on an essential truth that has been forgotten: finance can be just as principled, life-affirming, and worthyas it can be fraught with questionable practices. Today, finance is shrouded in mystery for outsiders, while many insiders are uneasy with the disrepute of their profession. How can finance become more accessible and also recover its nobility?\nHarvard Business School professor Mihir Desai, in his ""last lecture"" to the graduating Harvard MBA class of 2015, took up the cause of restoring humanity to finance. With incisive wit and irony, his lecture drew upon a rich knowledge of literature, film, history, and philosophy to explain the inner workings of finance in a manner that has never been seen before.\nThis book captures Desai's lucid exploration of the ideas of finance as seen through the unusual prism of the humanities. Through this novel, creative approach, Desai shows that outsiders can access the underlying ideas easily and insiders can reacquaint themselves with the core humanity of their profession.\nThe mix of finance and the humanities creates unusual pairings: Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope are guides to risk management; Jeff Koons becomes an advocate of leverage; and Mel Brooks's The Producersteaches us about fiduciary responsibility. In Desai's vision, the principles of finance also provide answers to critical questions in our lives. Among many surprising parallels, bankruptcy teaches us how to react to failure, the lessons of mergers apply to marriages, and the Capital Asset Pricing Model demonstrates the true value of relationships.\nTHE WISDOM OF FINANCE is a wholly unique book, offering a refreshing new perspective on one of the world's most complex and misunderstood professions.","223","23","5","2017","9780544911130","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30971680-the-wisdom-of-finance","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1475307109i/30971680.jpg","179","The Wisdom of Finance: Discovering Humanity in the World of Risk and Return","The Wisdom of Finance: Discovering Humanity in the World of Risk and Return","44.18","607","5.28 x 10.93 x 1.37 inches","0.2","1.31","1","3","Mihir Desai","41","18"

Her olfactory nerve was destroyed, perhaps forever. She had lost her sense of smell.\nPhantosmia--a constant stench of ""every disgusting thing you can think of tossed into a blender and pureed""--is the first disorienting stage. It's the brain's attempt, as Blodgett vividly conveys, to compensate for loss by conjuring up a tortured facsimile. As the hallucinations fade and anosmia (no smell at all) moves in to take their place, Blodgett is beset by questions: Why are smell and mood hand-in-hand? How are smell disorders linked to other diseases? What is taste without flavor? Blodgett's provocative conversations with renowned geneticists, smell dysfunction experts, neurobiologists, chefs, and others ultimately lead to a life-altering understanding of smell, and to the most transformative lesson of all: the olfactory nerve, in ways unlike any other in the human body has the extraordinary power to heal.","256","16","6","2010","9780618861880","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7950323-remembering-smell","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","177","Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense","Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense","99.62","934","7.31 x 7.6 x 2.26 inches","0.46","2.55","1","3","Bonnie Blodgett","43","14"

Here are men whose furrows are never quite straight and whose hearts are near to bursting with all the desires they have been told they aren't supposed to heed.\n""Bruce Machart is one of our most ambitious and fearless young writers.

Now, for the first time, based on numerous interviews with key insiders at the FBI and CIA as well as with Chinese agents and people close to them, David Wise tells the full story of China's many victories and defeats in its American spy wars.Two key cases interweave throughout: Katrina Leung, code-named Parlor Maid, worked for the FBI for years, even after she became a secret double agent for China, aided by love affairs with both of her FBI handlers. Here, too, is the inside story of the case, code-named Tiger Trap, of a key Chinese-American scientist suspected of stealing nuclear weapons secrets. These two cases led to many others, involving famous names from Wen Ho Lee to Richard Nixon, stunning national security leaks, and sophisticated cyberspying. The story takes us up to the present, with a West Coast spy ring whose members were sentenced in 2010--but it surely will continue for years to come, as China faces off against America. David Wise's history of China's spy wars in America is packed with eye-popping revelations.","304","14","6","2011","9780547553108","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10615536-tiger-trap","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","219","Tiger Trap: America's Secret Spy War with China","Tiger Trap: America's Secret Spy War with China","8.73","1503","6.14 x 7.39 x 2.68 inches","0.61","1.31","1","3","David Wise","51","38"

"469550","en-GB","4","Every spring, Little Leaguers across the country mimic his stance and squabble over the right to wear his number, 2, the next number to be retired by the world's most famous ball team. Derek Jeter is their hero. He walks in the footsteps of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, and Mantle, and someday his shadow will loom just as large. Yet he has never been the best player in baseball. In fact, he hasn't always been the best player on his team. But his intangible grace and Jordanesque ability to play big in the biggest of postseason moments make him the face of the modern Yankee dynasty, and of America's game.\nIn The Captain, best-selling author Ian O'Connor draws on extensive reporting and unique access to Jeter that has spanned some fifteen years to reveal how a biracial kid from Michigan became New York's most beloved sports figure and the enduring symbol of the steroid-free athlete. O'Connor takes us behind the scenes of a legendary baseball life and career, from Jeter's early struggles in the minor leagues, when homesickness and errors in the field threatened a stillborn career, to his heady days as a Yankee superstar and prince of the city who squired some of the world's most beautiful women, to his tense battles with former best friend A-Rod. We also witness Jeter struggling to come to terms with his declining skills and the declining favor of the only organization he ever wanted to play for, leading to a contentious contract negotiation with the Yankees that left people wondering if Jeter might end his career in a uniform without pinstripes.\nDerek Jeter's march toward the Hall of Fame has been dignified and certain, but behind that leadership and hero's grace there are hidden struggles and complexities that have never been explored, until now. As Jeter closes in on 3,000 hits, a number no Yankee has ever touched, The Captainoffers an incisive, exhilarating, and revealing new look at one of the game's greatest players in the gloaming of his career.","416","16","5","2011","9780547327938","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9925251-the-captain","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1299860161i/9925251.jpg","1085","The Captain: The Journey of Derek Jeter","The Captain: The Journey of Derek Jeter","17.21","602","9.29 x 14.09 x 1.02 inches","0.81","2.65","1","3","Ian O'Connor","55","14"

It is a rousing good ghost story, with many twists and turns, rather like taking apart a Russian matryoshka nesting doll.Gerard Freeman, at age ten, sneaks into his mother's room and unlocks a secret drawer, only to find a picture of a woman he has never seen before, but one that he will find again and again. His mother discovers him and gives him the beating of his life. Why this excessive reaction? She is a worried, paranoid, thin, and fretful type with an ""anxious, haunted look."" By tale's end, we know why.\nPhyllis Freeman, Gerard's mother, was happiest when speaking fondly of Staplefield, her childhood home, where there were things they ""didn't have in Mawson [Australia], chaffinches and mayflies and foxgloves and hawthorn, coopers and farriers and old Mr. Bartholomew who delivered fresh milk and eggs to their house with his horse and cart."" It's the sort of childhood idyll that the timid and lonely Gerard believes in and longs for. He strikes up a correspondence with an English ""penfriend,"" Alice Jessel, when he is 13 and a half, living in a desolate place with a frantic mother and a silent father. She is his age, her parents were killed in an accident and she has been crippled by it. She now lives in an institution, whose grounds she describes as much the way Staplefield looked. They go through young adulthood together, in letters only, thousands of miles apart, eventuallydeclaring their love for one another.\nInterwoven with the narrative of Alice and Gerard's letters are real ghost stories, the creation of Gerard's great-grandmother, Viola. At first, they seem to be scary Victorian tales of the supernatural. Then, we see that they have a spooky way of mirroring, or preceding, events in real life, off the page. Gerard comes upon them, one by one, in mysterious ways, but clearly something, or someone, is leading him. The stories seem to implicate his mother in some nefarious goings-on, but the truth is far worse than Gerard imagines.\nAny more would be telling too much. Turn on all the lights in the house when you settle down with this one, and plan to spend a long time reading because you will be lost in the story immediately. --Valerie Ryan","384","5","7","2004","9780151010745","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1200098.The_Ghost_Writer","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","241","The Ghost Writer","The Ghost Writer","40.18","487","6.98 x 8.74 x 2.13 inches","0.12","2.06","1","3","John Harwood","57","31"

But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him.

Now she turns her keen eye to another custom so frequently encountered that it often escapes notice: saying 'Thank you.' What do we really mean by these two simple words?\nThis fascinating inquiry into all aspects of gratitude ranges from the unusual determination with which parents teach their children to thank, to the difference between speaking the words and feeling them, to the ways different cultures handle the complex matters of giving, receiving, and returning favors and presents. Visser illuminates the fundamental opposition in our own culture between gift-giving and commodity exchange, and the similarities between gratitude and its opposite, vengefulness. The Gift of Thanks considers cultural history, including the modern battle of social scientists to pin down the notion of thankfulness and account for it, and the newly awakened scientific interest in the biological and evolutionary roots of emotions.\nWith her engaging combination of curiosity and erudition, Visser once again reveals the extraordinary in the everyday.","464","19","11","2009","9780151013319","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6626721-the-gift-of-thanks","https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","65","The Gift of Thanks: The Roots and Rituals of Gratitude","The Gift of Thanks: The Roots and Rituals of Gratitude","73.83","1918","6.02 x 10.41 x 2.87 inches","0.36","1.97","1","3","Margaret Visser","65","41"

"469676","eng","3","Acclaimed science writer Jennifer Ackerman lends her keen eye and lively voice to this marvellous exploration of the human body. Taking us through a typical day, from the arousal of the senses in the morning to the reverie of sleep and dreams, Ackerman reveals the human form as we've never seen it: busy, cunning, and miraculous.\nAdvances in genetics and medical imaging have allowed us to peer more deeply inside ourselves than ever before, revealing that we are intensely rhythmic creatures. The human body is like a clock -- an entire shop of clocks, actually -- measuring out the seconds, minutes, days, and seasons of life. Ackerman shows the importance of synchronising our actions with our biological rhythms -- and how defying them can cause us real harm.\nWe learn the best time of day to drink a cocktail, take a nap, run a race, give a presentation, and take medication, along with a host of other curious facts, such as why you succumb to a cold and your spouse doesn't, even though you've both been exposed to the same sick child.\nDid you know that you can tell time in your sleep? Or that up to half of the calories you consume can be burned off by fidgeting? That women have more nightmares than men?

Instead, Hildegard rejected Jutta's masochistic piety and found comfort and grace in studying books, growing herbs, and rejoicing in her own secret visions of the divine. When Jutta died some three decades later, Hildegard broke out of her prison with the heavenly calling to speak and write about her visions and to liberate her sisters and herself from the soul-destroying anchorage. Like Anita Diamant's portrayal of Dinah in The Red Tent,Mary Sharratt interweaves historical research with psychological insight and vivid imagination to write an engaging and triumphant portrait of a courageous and remarkably resilient woman and the life she might have lived.

She is drawn to their quiet contentment--reading on the couch, massaging each other's feet--so unlike her own lonely, chaotic world of nursing and soothing and simply getting by. One night, through that same window, she spies a young couple in the throes of passion. Who are these people, and what happened to her symbol of domestic bliss?\nIn the coming weeks, Nina encounters the older couple, Leon and Claudia, their daughter Emma and her fiance, and many others on the streets of her Upper West Side neighborhood, eroding the safe distance of her secret vigils. Soon anonymity gives way to different--and sometimes dangerous--forms of intimacy, and Nina and her neighbors each begin to question their own paths.\nWith enormous empathy and a keen observational eye, Tova Mirvis introduces a constellation of characters we all know: twenty-somethings unsure about commitments they haven't yet made; thirty-somethings unsure about the ones they have; and sixty-somethings whose empty nest causes all sorts of doubt.

Set in modern India, but where history still casts a long shadow, the stories move beyond the cities to places still haunted by the past, and to characters who are, each in their own way, masters of self-effacement.\nIn 'The Museum of Final Journeys' an unnamed government official is called upon to inspect a faded mansion of forgotten treasures, each sent home by the absent, itinerant master. As he is taken through the estate, wondering whether to save these precious relics, he reaches the final - greatest - gift of all, looming out of the shadows.\nIn 'Translator, Translated', middle-aged Prema meets her successful publisher friend Tara at a school reunion. Tara hires her as a translator, but Prema, buoyed by her work and the sense of purpose it brings, begins deliberately to blur the line between writer and translator, and in so doing risks unravelling her desires and achievements.\nThe final story is of Ravi, living hermit-like in the burnt-out shell of his family home high up in the Himalayan mountains. He cultivates not only silence and solitude but a secret hidden away in the woods, concealed from sight. When a film crew from Delhi intrude upon his seclusion, it compels him to withdraw even further until he magically and elusively disappears...\nRich and evocative, remarkable in their clarity and sensuous in their telling, these stories remind us of the extraordinary yet delicate power of this pre-eminent writer.","156","6","12","2011","9780547577456","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11346464-the-artist-of-disappearance","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328836954i/11346464.jpg","925","The Artist of Disappearance","The Artist of Disappearance","27.09","1842","9.21 x 10.2 x 2.83 inches","0.49","2.77","1","3","Anita Desai","77","43"

The daughter of a fiercely nationalistic sheep farmer, Esther yearns for a taste of the wider world that reaches her only through broadcasts on the BBC. Then, in the wake of D-day, the world comes to her in the form of a German POW camp set up on the outskirts of Esther's village.\nThe arrival of the Germans in the camp is a source of intense curiosity in the local pub, where Esther pulls pints for both her neighbors and the unwelcome British guards. One summer evening she follows a group of schoolboys to the camp boundary. As the boys heckle the prisoners across the barbed wire fence, one soldier seems to stand apart. He is Karsten Simmering, a German corporal, only eighteen, a young man of tormented conscience struggling to maintain his honor and humanity. To Esther's astonishment, Karsten calls out to her.\nThese two young people from worlds apart will be drawn into a perilous romance that calls into personal question the meaning of love, family, loyalty, and national identity. The consequences of their relationship resonate through the lives of a vividly imagined cast of characters: the drunken BBC comedian who befriends Esther, Esther's stubborn father, and the resentful young British ""evacuee"" who lives on the farm-even the German-Jewish interrogator investigating the most notorious German prisoner in Wales, Rudolf Hess.\nPeter Ho Davies has been hailed for his ""all-encompassing empathy that is without borders"" (Elle).

Playing off the book's title, Manning demonstrates that no one is common or simple. Instead, he creates a detailed, complex, and poignant portrait--by turns serious and hilarious, philosophical and speculative, but ultimately tragic--of a fast-disappearing aspect of American culture. The Common Man's accessibility and its enthusiastic and sincere charms make it the perfect antidote to the glib ironies that characterize much contemporary American verse.

Und keine an das Land namens DDR, in dem man geboren wurde? Wenn man auf das Gedachtnis anderer angewiesen ist, um die eigene Geschichte zu verstehen?\nSchon als Kind hatte Johanna eine Vorliebe fur Landkarten, die die Welt uberschaubar machten. Nach dem Abitur ist sie aus der Uckermark nach Berlin gezogen, wo sie zum Arger ihrer Mutter eine Ausbildung zur Strassenbahnfahrerin macht. Mit Reiner, ihrem Ausbilder, bewegt sie sich durch das wohlgeordnete Linien-netz der Grossstadt und lacht uber alte DDR-Witze, ohne sie zu verstehen. Mit Karl, dem elternlosen Weltenbummler, beginnt sie eine Affare. Ihr Vater Jens hat die Familie kurz vor dem Mauerfall verlassen, da war Johanna zwei. Ausser einer Postkarte an der Wand erinnert nichts an ihn. Doch dann ruft Jens an, und Johannas Lebenskonstrukt gerat ins Wanken. Plotzlich gibt es zahlreiche widerspruchliche Versionen seines Verschwindens. Ist er geflohen? Wurde er verhaftet? Hatte Johannas Mutter etwas damit zu tun oder gar Honeckers Krankengymnastin?

Einer engagierten Mutter, die ein muslimisches Kind gegen Anfeindungen in Schutz nimmt, verschwimmen schliesslich selbst die Grenzen zwischen Gut und Bose, Richtig und Falsch.

"469819","en-US","4","Here is a tasty paradox: How did the Leftist legions regroup after history delivered its fatal blow to the Soviet system? Simple, argues Jean-Francois Revel: the Left retreated to the impregnable fortress of the Utopian ideal. After all, socialism incarnate was always vulnerable to criticism. Utopia, on the other hand, lies by definition beyond reproach. With the demise of the Soviet system, there is no longer a vast and flailing embodiment of their vision, and Utopia's haughty champions can again rage boundlessly.\nIn Last Exit to Utopia, the latest English language translation of one of Europe's most controversial intellectuals, Jean-Francois Revel takes aim at socialist apologists who have attempted to erase or invert the manifest failures of socialist ideology. As the tide of Big Government rises in America, Revel's forewarnings here are as prescient as they are frightening.","300","15","12","2009","9781594032646","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7214750-last-exit-to-utopia","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328752406i/7214750.jpg","47","Last Exit to Utopia: The Survival of Socialism in a Post-Soviet Era","Last Exit to Utopia: The Survival of Socialism in a Post-Soviet Era","16.07","1305","9.54 x 10.64 x 0.78 inches","0.61","2.24","1","7","Jean-Francois Revel","92","12"
"469822","eng","3","The current frenzy over global warming has galvanized the public and cost taxpayers billons of dollars in federal expenditures for climate research. It has spawned Hollywood blockbusters and inspired major political movements. It has given a higher calling to celebrities and built a lucrative industry for scores of eager scientists. In short, ending climate change has become a national crusade. And yet, despite this dominant and sprawling campaign, the facts behind global warming remain as confounding as ever. In Climate Confusion, distinguished climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer observes that our obsession with global warming has only clouded the issue. Forsaking blindingly technical statistics and doomsday scenarios, Dr. Spencer explains in simple terms how the climate system really works, why man's role in global warming is more myth than science, and how the global warming hype has corrupted Washington and the scientific community. The reasons, Spencer explains, are numerous: biases in governmental funding of scientific research, our misconceptions about science and basic economics, even our religious beliefs and worldviews. From Al Gore to Leonardo DiCaprio, the climate change industry has given a platform to leading figures from all walks of life, as pandering politicians, demagogues and biased scientists forge a self-interested movement whose proposed policy initiatives could ultimately devastate the economies of those developing countries they purport to aid. Climate Confusion is a much needed wake up call for all of us on planet earth. Dr. Spencer's clear-eyed approach, combined with his sharp wit and intellect, brings transparency and levity to the issue of global warming as he takes on wrong-headed attitudes and misguided beliefs that have led to our state of panic. Climate Confusion lifts the shroud of mystery that has hovered here for far too long and offers an end to this frenzy of misinformation in our lives. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.","191","7","3","2008","9781594032103","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2169922.Climate_Confusion","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328752361i/2169922.jpg","159","Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies That Hurt the Poor","Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies That Hurt the Poor","10.66","510","8.65 x 8.23 x 1.02 inches","0.71","1.7","1","7","Roy W.

"469830","eng","4","Since the summer of 2014, America has been convulsed with a protest movement known as Black Lives Matter. That movement holds that police officers are among the greatest threats--if not the greatest threat--facing young black males today. Policing and the rest of the criminal justice system--from prosecutors to drug laws--single out minority communities for gratuitous and heavy-handed enforcement, the charge goes, resulting in an epidemic of ""mass incarceration"" that falls most heavily on blacks.\nThis book challenges that narrative. Through vivid, street-level reporting, it gives voice to the many residents of high-crime neighborhoods, rarely heard in the media, who support proactive policing and want more of it. The book will argue that there is no government agency more dedicated to the proposition that Black Lives Matter than today's data-driven, accountable police department. In New York City alone, over ten thousand minority males are alive who would have been killed had the New York Police Department not brought homicide in the city down 80% from its early 1990's level. The intelligence-led policing revolution that began in New York and spread nationally has transformed urban neighborhoods, freeing their residents from the thrall of daily fear.\nOther topics include such contested tactics as stop, question, and frisk and ""broken windows"" policing. The book will refute the argument that racist drug statutes and enforcement lie behind the black incarceration rate. It will take the reader inside prisons and jails. And it will argue that proactive policing has been the greatest public policy success story of the last quarter century, resulting in a record-breaking national crime drop that no criminologist or even police chief foresaw.\nThat crime drop is now at risk, however, thanks to the nonstop agitation against the police led by the Black Lives Matter movement. The book is a call for a more honest and informed debate about policing, crime, and race, before the public safety gains of the last twenty years are lost.","248","21","6","2016","9781594038754","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27036577-the-war-on-cops","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1461083336i/27036577.jpg","323","The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe","The War on Cops: How the New Attack on Law and Order Makes Everyone Less Safe","41.89","878","9.49 x 9.64 x 1.34 inches","0.42","0.76","1","7","Heather Mac Donald","94","18"
"469840","en-GB","3","The German Model is running out of steam. Both America's college and university system, and its K-12 education system, were originally created based on German approaches in the 19th century. Now that it's the 21st century, Glenn Harlan Reynolds suggests, it's time for a change.\nHigher education in America is facing a bust much like the housing bubble. It is the product of cheap credit, coupled with popular expectations of ever-increasing returns on investment and, as with housing prices, the cheap credit has caused college tuitions to vastly outpace inflation and family incomes. Now this bubble is bursting. Reynolds explains the causes and effects of this bubble and the steps colleges and universities must take to ensure their survival. As students become less willing to incur debt for education, colleges and universities will have to adapt to a new world of cost pressures and declining public support.\nEconomist Herb Stein famously said that something that can't go on forever, won't. For decades now, America has been putting ever-growing amounts of money into its K-12 education system, while getting steadily poorer results. Now parents are losing faith in public schools, new alternatives are appearing, and change is on the way. As the best students abandon traditional public schools, Disruptedprovides a succinct description of what's wrong, and where the solutions are likely to appear, along with advice for parents, educators, and taxpayers.","121","7","1","2014","9781594037108","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17290889-the-new-school","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381324987i/17290889.jpg","84","The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself","The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself","67.77","1874","5.64 x 11.62 x 0.73 inches","0.47","2.61","1","7","Glenn Harlan Reynolds","95","41"
"469842","eng","3","In ""Christianity on Trial,"" Vincent Carroll and David Shiflett do not shrink from confronting the tragedies that have been perpetrated throughout the ages in the name of Christianity. But they argue that the current indulgence of anti-Christian rhetoric in our culture not only involves bad taste, but tunnel vision and willful historical illiteracy as well. Carroll and Shiflett dispassionately consider the indictment of Christianity--specifically that it has justified racism and misogyny, encouraged ignorance, and promoted the despoliation of the environment and even justified genocide. Then, in a narrative whose intellectual elegance and verve calls up comparisons to ""How the Irish Saved Civilization,"" they answer these charges, showing how in fact the Christian tradition has not only injected morality into our political order, but softened brutal practices and confining superstitions, created the foundation for intellectual inquiry, and created the compassionate! impulse. ""Christianity on Trial"" challenges readers of all beliefs--even those with a belief in disbelief itself--to question the anti-religious bigotry that thrives in our intellectual world and to reevaluate the role of Christianity not only as a source of consolation but of enlightenment and human liberation as well.","204","1","12","2001","9781893554153","https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1736116.Christianity_On_Trial","https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328697114i/1736116.jpg","47","Christianity On Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry","Christianity On Trial: Arguments Against Anti-Religious Bigotry","32.27","1278","8.12 x 7.2 x 2.43 inches","0.84","2.28","2","7","Vincent Carroll","96","1"
